/*!
    Selects the best physical device and creates a logical device with graphics + present queues.

    The requirements are deliberately modest: Vulkan 1.3 core (dynamic rendering and
    synchronisation2), the swapchain extension, and a queue family that can both render and
    present. Ray traversal is performed by hand in ordinary compute shaders against a
    self-built BVH held in storage buffers, so no hardware ray-tracing or mesh-shader
    extension is requested and the device is creatable on modest GPUs such as a GTX 1650 Ti.
