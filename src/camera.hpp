/*!
    Free-flight spectator camera with quaternion orientation.

    This is the camera used by the human observer in the debug window, and during development to
    inspect the world. It is not a player camera: the world is inhabited exclusively by AI creature
    agents, and a human never controls an inhabitant. The camera exists purely so that a developer
    can fly around, watch what the creatures do, and verify that the renderer behaves.

    Supports WASD + mouse look. Movement is in local camera space (forward/right relative to where
    the camera is looking), with vertical movement along the world up axis. Rotation is
    quaternion-based — no gimbal lock.

    Note that creature sensors do not use this class. Each creature's eye derives its own view and
    projection matrices directly from that creature's own state (position, head orientation, field
    of view), and renders at its own tiny sensor resolution. Changing the spectator camera therefore
    has no effect whatsoever on what any creature perceives.
