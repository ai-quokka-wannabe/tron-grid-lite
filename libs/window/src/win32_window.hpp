            The flag alone is not enough. Neither platform generates a motion event when the pointer
            is already at the destination — which happens routinely, because the window is created
            centred and the user clicks near its middle to focus it. The flag then stays set and
            swallows the user's next genuine movement instead. Matching the position as well means a
            warp that moved nothing consumes nothing.
