        Thread-safe logger that writes messages on a background thread.

        Uses SignalsLib::Signal<LogMessage> as the internal queue. Any thread
        can call logDebug(), logInfo(), etc. The background worker drains
        the queue and writes to stdout (Debug, Info) or stderr (Warning,
        Error).

        Fatal is the exception: it is written synchronously to stderr rather
        than queued, because it exists to be read immediately before the
        process dies. That makes it arrive out of order with respect to
        anything still queued, so logFatal() flushes the queue first.

        RAII lifecycle: std::jthread auto-joins in the destructor and
        signals the stop_token to wake the worker.

            std::abort() joins no threads, runs no static destructors and is not required to flush
            the standard streams — glibc and the MSVC CRT do not. Without this, everything the
            program logged on its way to a fatal error is silently discarded, leaving a user with a
            single line of context and no idea what led to it.
